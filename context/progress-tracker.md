## Decisions Made During Build

- **01 Homepage** — `public/` had no images, so the dashboard, jobs table, and agent-run previews are recreated as CSS/HTML mockups (not screenshots), matching the design.
- **Marketing CTA style** — Per the design, the primary marketing button ("Get Started" / "Start for free") is dark (`bg-overlay-dark`), not the app's purple primary button from `ui-rules`. The purple primary spec still applies to in-app buttons.
- **CTA routing** — All marketing CTAs link to `/login` for now; the auth-aware redirect (logged-in → `/dashboard`) will be wired in Feature 02.
- **Root layout** — Switched fonts from Geist to Inter (`next/font/google`, `variable: "--font-sans"`) per `ui-rules`; set real page `metadata`.
- **tsconfig** — Excluded gitignored tooling folders (`ECC`, `.claude`, `.cursor`, `graphify-out`) from TypeScript so `next build` type-checks only app code (an ECC skill sample was breaking the build).
- **02 Auth — SDK reality vs docs** — The context files assumed a Supabase-style `@insforge/ssr` package (`createBrowserClient`/`createServerClient`, cookie SSR, `insforge.from(...)`). That package does not exist. Built against the real `@insforge/sdk` (browser-first: `createClient`, `auth.signInWithOAuth`, `auth.getCurrentUser`, `auth.signOut`, `insforge.database.from(...)`). `@insforge/react` is deprecated, so auth state uses a custom `AuthProvider`/`useUser()` context instead. `architecture.md`, `library-docs.md`, and `code-standards.md` were updated to match.
- **02 Auth — route protection** — Client-side via `AuthGuard` (`useUser()` redirect to `/login`). No `middleware.ts` — the browser-first SDK has no server cookie helper.
- **02 Auth — OAuth callback** — `/callback` relies on the SDK auto-detecting `insforge_code` (surfaced through `getCurrentUser()` in `AuthProvider`), then redirects to `/dashboard`.
- **02 Auth — temp dashboard** — `app/dashboard/page.tsx` is a temporary `AuthGuard`-wrapped placeholder (shows user email + Sign out) so the auth loop is testable now; replaced by Feature 14.
- **02 Auth — deferred** — Server-side InsForge access (user-scoped DB writes in Server Actions/API routes) is undecided; resolve in Feature 06. PostHog `identify()`/`reset()` hook points left for Feature 03.
- **02 Auth — manual prerequisite** — Google and GitHub OAuth providers must be enabled in the InsForge dashboard with `http://localhost:3000/callback` in `allowedRedirectUrls` before OAuth works end to end.
